Our 2021 Building a Better World report summarizes publicly available information on PFAS uses in the built environment and proposes a path forward to reducing PFAS use in building materials. Building owners, architects, designers, contractors, manufacturers, and regulators are encouraged to identify and eliminate non-essential uses of PFAS in buildings.
